# Assignment 2: Working with Github

- Data Science Project Course
- José de Jesús Carbajal Castellanos

This repository is an assignment on learning how to use git by creating and managing a repository and its branches, it contains two branches, the main one, where you are currently standing: it only contains this README file, and there is a seccond branch called 'feature-1' with a Jupyter Notebook with a summary on MLops and deployment and their importance.

This activity helped me to understand deeply about MLOps and deployment, to get a better insight on what are we going to learn in the class and also have a individual contact with git to learn how to manage the repo from my enviroment and finally checking every change in github or a git extension.
